                <b> Editor’s note: </b>We explain why e-retailers should manage their business as a coherent ecosystem
                rather than a disparate set of isolated systems. Read on to learn about the benefits of implementing

    <p class="mt-3.5 text-xl">
        The common business practice of distinguishing between the back and front offices extends to the ecommerce
        domain. As the front office, ecommerce businesses have websites (digital storefronts) to interact with customers
        while the back office encompasses a sequence of workflows to keep the business functioning. An Enterprise
        Resource Planning (ERP) application supports most of these processes, and it is important for their effective
        automation.
    <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
        There’s no default integration between an ecommerce application and an ERP system. And while setting it up
        requires certain effort, the benefits are well worth it.

            <strong>
                1. Time-saving automation
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            The day-to-day operation of an ecommerce business involves a variety of manual tasks, ranging from simple
            ones such as entering data into forms to more complex related to transferring data between applications.
            Though essential, such tasks are time-consuming and error-prone.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            The solution to this problem is automation. When integrated, an ecommerce platform and ERP exchange the data
            routinely, which eases the burden of manual data transfer and prevents data errors. Time saved in the daily
            routine of your team would be better spent on high-value tasks.
        </p>

    <div class="mt-6">

            <strong>
                2. Data consistency and data centralization
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            In ecommerce, data originates in multiple sources and flows in multiple directions. Customers place online
            orders, thus triggering payment and order management processes. Once an order is shipped, a business needs
            to keep the customer updated on its route as well as write the item off the inventory and control the stock
            levels to prevent stockouts. And that’s how sales, finance, logistics, and procurement teams have their role
            in data management.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            ERP and ecommerce integration maintains the integrity and visibility of your data, which positively affects
            the team’s productivity and customer experience.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-6">
        <p class="text-3xl">
            <strong>
                3. Shorter order fulfillment cycle
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            An online sales process is two-step. Customers move through the sales funnel until they reach the point of
            placing an order. After that, the product moves physically from the warehouse to the destination.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            ERP and ecommerce integration makes these two processes work in unison. Order information gets transferred
            in real time to order management and warehousing systems and is processed promptly. This way, the journey
            from order placement to fulfillment is shortened.

                4. Enhanced customer service
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            Customer service is essential for customer retention. Crafting personalized and helpful responses to
            customer queries requires access to up-do-date customer and product data, a possibility to reach customers
            via different communication channels, deep knowledge of company products and services, etc. In a way,
            customer service is the integration point of all other teams and departments.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            Having your ecommerce storefront integrated with ERP makes it easier for your agents to react to customer
            demands in real time, for example, provide them with the latest order status information.
