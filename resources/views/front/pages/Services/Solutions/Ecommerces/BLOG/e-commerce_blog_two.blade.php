            To convert and successfully retain customers, a retailer has to provide them with a compelling shopping
            experience. Conventional online shopping with lengthy browsing of numerous product lists can be
            perceived as a chore, while virtual shopping can be a way more personal, enjoyable experience. A virtual
            store is still an emerging form of ecommerce, but it’s gaining in popularity at quite a rapid pace – an
            estimated 100 million people are already using VR and AR to shop.

            Virtual stores employ computer simulation technologies to create the virtual environment of a physical
            store. A customer can walk around the store, interact with accurate 3D models of products, instantly add
            them to a virtual shopping cart, and more.

                3D virtual stores, AR applications, and virtual reality stores are three major types of virtual shops.
                Their difference lies in the technologies implemented and the resulting level of a customer’s
                engagement.

            You can power an ecommerce application with 3D shopping experience so that customers move in a virtual shop,
            browse and zoom any product they like. No additional devices are required. To get a clearer impression of
            what experience the 3D technology provides, read about one of ScienceSoft’s projects – 3D virtual store

            Ecommerce brands can use AR applications to provide for informed product choices and enhance the after-sale

            augmented reality can be incorporated into a shopping routine and bring an element of fun into the shopping

            Virtual reality shopping has manifested in retail as a way to create a more immersive experience for
            customers. Though its application in ecommerce is questionable due to special equipment such as a VR headset
            and hand controllers required, the technology can differentiate customers’ in-store experience. For example,
            retailers may offer a virtual tour across a large mall or welcome customers to a behind-the-scenes tour to
            see how products are produced.

            Combining the capabilities of both offline and online shopping, a virtual online store brings an informative
            and joyful element of real shopping to online retail. Here are some of the opportunities that virtual
            shopping opens to customers.

        <p class="text-xl mt-3.5">
            Customers are more likely to make a purchase after they receive all information they need, and a virtual
            store provides an opportunity to try a product before buying. A buyer can pick the interactive 3D model of a
            product, examine it from different angles, and even preview in real surroundings, which results in a careful
            and informed product choice and fewer product returns.

            Just like in a physical store, customers can get help during online shopping and after the purchase is made.
            For example, customers can turn to a virtual shopping assistant and have their questions answered straight
            away.

            for a multiuser experience. Customers can visit a visually appealing virtual online store with their

            Most of the advantages featured by virtual stores are not actually new, as they often constitute customer
            experience in brick-and-mortar retail. Their originality comes from incorporating those elements into an
            ecommerce solution and blurring the boundaries between the two retail channels. As a result, customers can
            fully experience products and perceive shopping as an engaging activity that they will be glad to repeat.
